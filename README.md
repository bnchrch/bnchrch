## Hi! My name's Ben

I'm a Remote Engineer based in Los Angeles though I work exclusively remote. I've led several engineering teams & worked with some awesome companies including `Uber`, `Facebook` & `Lonely Planet`.

Previously I led a consultancy called [ShipWithUs](https://www.shipwithus.io/) which worked hard to give our clients a meaningful competitive advantage over their markets using tools which we believe are the future of development. React Native, GraphQL, Next.js and Elixir to name a few.

Now I'm a Staff Engineer at [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) writing open source and moving data for the worlds largest and most innovative companies (`Perplexity`, `Cart`, `Unity`, `Seimens`, `Datadog`, etc...)
